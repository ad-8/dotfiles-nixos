#+title: Readme

* FreeBSD
Edit =config.mk= so you can build dwm on FreeBSD, more precisely the following lines:

#+begin_src shell
X11INC = /usr/X11R6/include                      ->          X11INC = /usr/local/include
X11LIB = /usr/X11R6/lib                          ->          X11LIB = /usr/local/lib
FREETYPEINC = /usr/include/freetype2             ->          FREETYPEINC = /usr/local/include/freetype2
#+end_src

now ~make~ and ~make clean install~ should work

** dwm.desktop
- copy into =/usr/local/share/xsessions= 
- make sure all users have read permissions with =chmod +r dwm.desktop=,
  else it won't show up in =lightdm=
